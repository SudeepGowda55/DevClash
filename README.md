In MediForest we aimed to develop predictive models for two significant medical conditions, Parkinson's disease and heart disease, using logistic regression as the primary classification algorithm. Through a systematic methodology encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, we have achieved valuable insights and outcomes.

The utilization of logistic regression allowed us to effectively model the relationship between relevant features and the binary outcomes of Parkinson's disease and heart disease. By leveraging the logistic function, we estimated the probabilities of individuals belonging to specific categories, enabling accurate classification and risk estimation.

Our findings highlight the importance of early detection and accurate prediction in the context of medical diagnostics. The developed models demonstrated promising performance in distinguishing between individuals with and without the target conditions, facilitating timely intervention and personalized healthcare strategies.

Furthermore, the interpretability of the logistic regression models provided valuable insights into the underlying factors influencing disease occurrence and progression. By examining the coefficients and odds ratios associated with each feature, we gained a deeper understanding of the predictive relationships and potential biomarkers associated with Parkinson's disease and heart disease.

Moving forward, the insights derived from this project can inform clinical practice, guide decision-making processes, and contribute to ongoing research efforts in the field of medical diagnostics and prognostics. Continued refinement of predictive models, incorporation of additional data sources, and validation in diverse patient populations are essential for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of the developed models.
